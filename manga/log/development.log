La sœur jumelle du garçon, très choquée, est elle aussi hospitalisée ; leurs parents adoptifs viennent d'être assassinés sauvagement chez eux.

Pourtant, un jour, il refuse de donner en priorité ses soins au maire de la ville et préfère opérer un garçon blessé d'une balle dans la tête, arrivé à l'hôpital avant le maire. La sœur jumelle du garçon, très choquée, est elle aussi hospitalisée ; leurs parents adoptifs viennent d'être assassinés sauvagement chez eux.

C'est l'inspecteur Runge de la police criminelle — un homme rigide à tendance obsessionnelle — qui reprend en charge l'enquête après la police de province allemande ; il soupçonne évidemment Tenma, qui avait obtenu le poste de chef de service de chirurgie à la suite du décès de ses collègues.

Fujimaru Takagi, jeune hacker de génie, connu sous pseudonyme Falcon, collabore avec la Third-I, l'agence gouvernementale d'investigation de la sécurité publique, pour décoder les informations présentes sur la puce. Dans le même temps, son père, Ryûnosuke Takagi, sous-directeur de l'agence, est recherché pour le meurtre de l'agent russe, il est donc condamné à se cacher le temps que son fils découvre l'identité du vrai tueur. Fujimaru déchiffre, avec ses amis, une vidéo intitulée Carnage de Noël où l'on peut voir tout un village se vider de son sang. Le petit génie du hacking et ses amis en déduisent que seul un virus serait capable de faire une telle chose. Les choses se compliquent encore lorsque la terroriste Maya Orihara, responsable de tout ceci et ayant eu vent que Fujimaru pouvait remettre en cause ses projets, va tenter de se rapprocher du hacker et de ses amis en s'infiltrant dans leur lycée en tant que professeur."], ["begin", 1], ["final", 5], ["missing_tome", "-"], ["complete", 0], ["author", "Megumi Kouji; Ryûmon Ryô"], ["editor", "Pika Édition"], ["release_date", 2007], ["genre", "Shonen"], ["created_at", "2016-09-22 12:28:22.987183"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-22 12:28:22.987183"]]

Kenzô Tenma, le personnage principal, est un jeune neurochirurgien japonais aux compétences hors normes. Il est fiancé à Eva Heineman, la fille du directeur de l'hôpital, et est destiné à une brillante carrière. Pourtant, un jour, il refuse de donner en priorité ses soins au maire de la ville et préfère opérer un garçon blessé d'une balle dans la tête, arrivé à l'hôpital avant le maire. La sœur jumelle du garçon, très choquée, est elle aussi hospitalisée ; leurs parents adoptifs viennent d'être assassinés sauvagement chez eux. Le garçon s'en sort, mais le maire, confié à un autre chirurgien, décède. Le Dr Tenma est alors rétrogradé par le directeur de l'hôpital, et sa fiancée le quitte. Peu de temps après, le garçon et sa sœur disparaissent, à la suite des meurtres mystérieux de trois hauts responsables de l'établissement, dont le directeur. Neuf ans plus tard, Tenma découvre l'auteur des meurtres : Johann, ce garçon de 10 ans qu'il avait sauvé semble être devenu un monstre semant la terreur autour de lui. C'est l'inspecteur Runge de la police criminelle — un homme rigide à tendance obsessionnelle — qui reprend en charge l'enquête après la police de province allemande ; il soupçonne évidemment Tenma, qui avait obtenu le poste de chef de service de chirurgie à la suite du décès de ses collègues. S'appuyant sur les faits plutôt que les rumeurs s'amplifiant autour de la personnalité du Dr Tenma, Rünge le poursuit sans relâche, tandis que ce dernier est à la recherche de Johann, pour l'arrêter. Au fil du récit, il est révélé que Johann et sa sœur Anna sont des enfants issus de pratiques eugénistes.
