== README

================ Ruby version : 2.3.0

================ Setup process :
	
	In the console, go to the root folder of the application.
	
	Once there, to initiate the database, execute the shell script 'majbdd.sh'.
	
	Then execute the command 'rails server' to launch the app.
	
================ The database :

	There are 3 tables in the database : users | ouvrages | commentaries
	
	The ouvrages table is initialized with the shell script majbdd.sh executed during the setup.
	
	The users and commentaries tables are initially empty and are dynamically filled (with registrations and comments on series)
	
	The user table is initialized with an admin account.
	
	The commentaries table is currently unused, as the add comment function is unoperationnal.
	
	 - ouvrages table :
	 	the table is composed of a title, a synopsis, the number of the first and final tome possessed, the list of missing tomes, the author, the editor, the release date, genre, a cover(useless).
	 	
	 - commentaries table :
	 	composed of 2 foreign keys, one for the posting user, the other for the corresponding manga, a text, a date and a note.
	 	
	 - users table :
	 composed of an active/admin status, a name, a surname, pseudonyme, course, year, different dates, the email, the encrypted password, the current and last ip used by the account, the confirmation token and 3 string types corresponding to the borrows made by the account.

=============== The app :
	
	Once the app is launched, go in your internet browser and enter the URL : http://localhost:3000
	This will bring you to the home page of the site.
	
	On the home page, you can either browse through the site and see its contents, or you can create an account by clcking the 'S'inscrire' button.
	
	The 'Home' button will bring you back to the home page (it is not completely finished, a few adjustments are necessary).
	
	The 'Liste de Manga' button will lead you to the list of all available series with links to their dedicated pages.
	
	The 'Random' button will randomly lead you to one of the series (it might lead to an error on some very few occurences : need verification).
	
	When you're connected, you will see a 'Sign_out' button as well as a 'Profil' button.
	
	The 'Sign_out' button will disconnect you.
	On the profil page you can see a recap of your informations (not all the information displayed is currently available to the users)
	
	If you're an admin, you will also see a 'Utilisateurs' button which will lead you to the list of all users with their base informations (as well as a button to delete an account in the long term).
	
	All users are able to borrow a manga, if it is available (feature not entirely operationnal : in development).
	
================ Registration
	
	If you so wish, you can create an account by clicking on 'S'inscrire'. You will be then asked to provide an email address and a password. Once created, you should receive an email in your mail box signaling you that your account has been created and asking you to confirm the creation by clicking on a link. If you don't confirm your account creation, you will have access to the site only during 2 days.
	
================ Becoming an administrator

	If you have access to the source code of the app, on the console type 'rails console' to have access to the database. There type the following 2 commands to become administrator :
	u = User.find_by_email("mymailaddress@example.com")
	u.update_attributes(admin: true)
	
	The account associated with the address "mymailaddress@example.com" will then be an admin.
	
	(On the long term, administrators will be able to grant admin rights to non-admin accounts directly from the site).
